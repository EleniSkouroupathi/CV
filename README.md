# Eleni Skouroupathi

An enthusiastic individual with a passion for all things software. How it works, how it is made, and most importantly, how to make it. I have come to possess a keen affinity for design on all levels: from a beautiful UI/UX to well written design pattern. Actively seeking a developer role.
